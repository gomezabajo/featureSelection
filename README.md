# Data science featureSelection methods in Java

This repository holds a simple Java project to perform the sequential forward and backward feature selection methods.

This project is inspired by the project [FeatureSelectionWithJava](https://github.com/benjaminpatrickevans/FeatureSelectionWithJava) provided by [Benjamin Patrick Evans](https://github.com/benjaminpatrickevans).

Please note that this code takes a simplification of the MIFS approximation to the metric using $\beta$ = 1.
